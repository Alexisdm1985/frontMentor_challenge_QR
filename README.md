## My process

Well, first time doing a challenge and I just learning how basic html and css works, so it was hard for me to figure it out how to align everything.

### Built with

- HTML5
- Basic CSS (no grid, no flexbox)

### What I learned

I learned how to write a basic HTML  (I'm a really newbie), also some CSS basics properties, 
how to center a div and I learned how CSS box-model works.

### Continued development

I want to keep doing this challenges cause I want to improve my coding skills so the next step is to learn how Grid and Flexbox works to make some responsive design stuff!
